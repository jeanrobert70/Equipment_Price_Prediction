# Equipment Price Prediction

The objective of this project is to predict the auction sale price for a piece of heavy equipment to create a "blue book" for bulldozers. It was part of a kaggle compeition that was launced under the Kaggle Startup Program. The data is sourced from auction result postings and includes information on usage and equipment configurations.  It can be downloaded from kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data.

## The key fields used to predict the assets auction price:

* SalesID: the uniue identifier of the sale
* MachineID: the unique identifier of a machine.  A machine can be sold multiple times
* saleprice: what the machine sold for at auction (only provided in train.csv)
* saledate: the date of the sale

## We're going to take the follow approach:
